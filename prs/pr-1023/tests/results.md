# PR #1023 Test Results

## Recorded Proof

The `head` to `sed -n '1p'` sweep is the right pipefail-safe repair. Syntax checks passed on all changed scripts, and a `set -euo pipefail` reproduction with multi-line input returned the first line cleanly.

## Baseline / PR Comparison

The original audit ledger records the tests, reproductions, or static proof used
for this PR. Where a specific baseline reproduction was not captured, that is a
known limitation and should be treated as residual risk rather than inferred
coverage.

## Environment

Most tests were run from the local audit workspace using Git Bash/PowerShell on
Windows with Docker available. Hardware-specific GPU behavior was simulated
unless explicitly noted. See `testing/hardware/amd-gpu-testing.md` and
`testing/baseline.md` for the audit environment caveats.
